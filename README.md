# Timber_Connection_Fire

Once the timber connection configuration is determined, the evaluation procedure can be conducted as below:

** Step 1:** Develop the high-fidelity model for the designed connection.

## Step 2: 
Develop the low-fidelity connection model for the designed connection with package LFM.

## Step 3: 
Integrate the displacements or fire resistance times from both high-fidelity models and low-fidelity models and develop MFNN with package MFNN.

## Step 4: 
Conduct probabilistic fire engineering, i.e., reliability, sensitivity, and fragility analysis, for designed timber connection using developed MFNN and comprehensively evaluate its fire performance.
